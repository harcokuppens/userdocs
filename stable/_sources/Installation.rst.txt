# Installation

The release can be downloaded from
`releases <https://github.com/TorXakis/TorXakis/releases>`__. For
windows an installer is provided.

# Development

To obtain the development version: \* Clone the github archive using the
URL https://github.com/TorXakis/TorXakis.git. \* Install stack \* Run
``stack install`` (takes over 1 hour) or ``stack install --fast`` \*
Install a SMT solver \* Configure TorXakis to use the installed SMT
Solver.

The installation of a SMT Solver is described in more details in the
following subsection.

Install SMT Solver
------------------

| TorXakis uses a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver to handle
  the data constraints. For more info on SMT and the available SMT
  solvers see e.g. \ `wiki on satisfiability modulo
  theories <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories>`__.
| TorXakis requires at least one installed SMT Solver.
| However, since your TorXakis model determines how the SMT solver will
  be used, and each SMT solver has its strengths and weaknesses,
| you might want to install multiple SMT Solvers and experiment with
  which SMT solver to use.

The TorXakis requirements for the SMT solver are

1. Support the `SMT-LIB version 2.5
   standard <http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/papers/smt-lib-reference-v2.5-r2015-06-28.pdf>`__
2. Support algebraic datatypes (as in the `SMT-LIB version 2.6 standard
   draft <http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/papers/smt-lib-reference-v2.6-draft-1.pdf>`__)
3. Support `strings <http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/wiki/Strings>`__ (which will
   probably be included in the SMT-LIB version 3.0 standard)

Since, some of the features TorXakis requires are not yet standardized,
official releases of SMT solvers supporting all required features do not
exist.

TorXakis has been extensively tested with development versions of the
SMT solvers `CVC4 <http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/>`__ and
`Z3 <https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/wiki>`__.

-  The development version of CVC4 for multiple different platforms can
   be downloaded from http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/downloads/ in the right
   column.
-  The development version of Z3 for multiple different platforms can be
   downloaded from https://github.com/Z3Prover/bin/tree/master/nightly
